# Overview

The idea behind my dotfiles is to keep them as simple as possible. To achieve
that I use [one org file](dotfiles/dotfiles.org) with tangling. This
allows me to have a clean and productive environment without spending a lot of
time configuring it (which I did in past 🙁).

# Workflow

I am mostly focused on software development and only need emacs and browser.

I mostly work on laptop, sometimes with external monitor, without any other
peripherals. Currently I use two laptops: one with linux and one with macOS.

For programming I use emacs - doom makes configuring and using emacs simple and
effective, the best code editor I have ever used.

For interacting with git I also use emacs - magit 😍.

For note taking and organizing my life I also use emacs - org mode 😍.
