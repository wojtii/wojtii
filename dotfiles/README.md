# Overview

I am mostly focused on software development and only need emacs and browser.

I mostly work on laptop, sometimes with external monitor, without any other
peripherals. Currently I use two laptops: one with linux and one with macOS, but
I will probably focus on macOS more in the near future.

For programming I use emacs - doom makes configuring and using emacs simple and
effective, the best code editor I have ever used.

For interacting with git I also use emacs - magit 😍.

For note taking and organizing my life I also use emacs - org mode 😍.

And dired is also cool 😎.

My fallback editor is vs code and vim with iterm2 for quick edits 🙂.
