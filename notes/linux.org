#+TITLE: my linux

* TLDR
Currently I use Ubuntu and macOS with emacs and firefox. Thats all I need and I am in love with this simple setup.

* Distributions
** Arch / Manjaro
- probably my favourites due to pacman
** Ubuntu
- my daily driver/production os, since it never let me down

* Window managers and desktop environments
Since I have started using emacs I noticed I don't need sophisticated wm/de
** Gnome
- my daily driver, only change I need is mapping capslock to ctrl/esc with this script:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps && xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'
  #+END_SRC
** Xmonad
- I have used it daily, wish it had better integration with polybar
** Exwm
- played with it a little but it is not mature enough to be on my production machine
** Other
- I have tried things like xfce, kde, i3 but I could not set up a satisfying
  environment there

* Programs
** Emacs
- main text editor
- doom emacs
** Firefox
- browser
- with vimium plugin
